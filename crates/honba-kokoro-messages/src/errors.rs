//! The stable error taxonomy (docs/archive/plan.md E0-S5, §4.2).
//!
//! No error crosses a surface — Python, REST, WASM, MCP — without one of these
//! codes. The taxonomy lives in `honba-messages` (L0) rather than in the API
//! crate because the envelope that carries an error is itself a wire type, and
//! because the code generator must be able to reach the codes without depending
//! on a higher layer.
//!
//! Two properties make the taxonomy usable across languages:
//!
//! - [`ErrorCode::ALL`] is generated from the definition, so a new variant
//!   cannot be added without it appearing in the published list.
//! - Each code declares its [`ErrorCategory`] and its retryability, so callers
//!   branch on a closed set instead of parsing message text.
