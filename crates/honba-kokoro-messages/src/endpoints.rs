//! The endpoint registry (docs/archive/plan.md E11-S1).
//!
//! One table describes every endpoint: its method, path, and the request and
//! response types inside the envelope. Two consumers read it, which is the point:
//!
//! - `honba-codegen` walks it to emit OpenAPI `paths`, so the served spec can
//!   never describe a route the router does not have.
//! - The REST layer registers routes from it, so adding an endpoint is one row
//!   rather than a router edit plus a spec edit.
//!
//! Every response is `ResponseEnvelope<T>`, so the registry records only the
//! payload type `T`.
